This is an invited post on the [TensorFlow blog][tf-blog] about the paper ["Layerwise learning for quantum neural networks"][ll-paper], which was joint work the [Google AI Quantum][google-quantum] team that we released in June. This blog post gives a short summary of our paper geared towards a machine learning audience.

Head over to the [TensorFlow blog to tread the full post][ll-blog]!
